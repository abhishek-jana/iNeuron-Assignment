    "### 1. To what does a relative path refer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Relative path refers to a location relative to the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What does an absolute path start with your operating system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Absolute path starts with the root directory and requires the complete path of the directories and subdirectories needed to locate a file or folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "os.chdir() -- means change directory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What are the . and .. folders?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: '.' is the current directory and '..' is the parent directory. This is useful as we don't have to type the entire path to access some file/folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: The three modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "read -- used to read a file\n",
    "\n",
    "write -- used to write in a file\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "test line two\n",
    "\n",
    "testline three\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "test line one\n",
    "\n",
    "test line two\n",
    "\n",
    "testline three\n",
    "\n",
    "and readlines() method will return:\n",
