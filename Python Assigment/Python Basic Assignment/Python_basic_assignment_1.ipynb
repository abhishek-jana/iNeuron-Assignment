    "### 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "'*'   Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'hello' Value\n",
    "\n",
    "'-87.8'  Value\n",
    "\n",
    "'-'  Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'/'  Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'•'  Expression\n",
    "    \n",
    "'6'  Value\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Variable is a memory location for a data type. String is a type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. String - string is a sequence of charectors which is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer – Integer is a mathemetical value with no decimal point and can do mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "list – this is used to store multible values in a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Expression contains operators, values. Expression can be used to evaluate a mathematical operation. For example, 3 + 2 is an expression which will give us 5 as an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Expression contains operators, values an return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement never returns a vlaue. Some of the examples are conditional statement, assignment statement. ‘spam = 10’ is an assignment statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Bacon will be 22 because bacon + 1 is not updated in the bacon variable. So the value of bacon remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 1st item) ‘spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "       2nd item) ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "       \n",
    "### 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Eggs is a vairiable because it’s a string but varibale cannot begin with a number hence 100 is not a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. int() to get integers, float() to get floating-point number and str() to get string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 99 is an integer. We cannot operate on different data types. To fix this we need to change 99 to string:\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'\n"
