    "#### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Abstract superclass calls a method that is filled by a subclass. This is a more generalized from of class which becomes more defined once a more specific subclass is coded. In OOP framework this is more like a user defined, customizable operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A basic assignment statement (like a = 5) at top level of a class statement will attach the data attribute to the class (Class.a) and will be shared by all class instances. Data attributes will not be callable function methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A class need to manually call a superclass's \\_\\_init__ method if it wants to run the superclass's construction code. Python will by default run the lowest constructor in the tree. Superclass constructors are called manually like the following: SuperclassName.\\_\\_init__(self,...) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. To augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method, redefine the method in a subclass, and callback to the superclass's method manually from the new method in the subclass. For example, Superclass.method(self, ...). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A class has access to enclosed local scope, but they cannot be used in a nested code. Similar to modules, the class's local scope is accessed through an attribute namespace after the class statement is run."
