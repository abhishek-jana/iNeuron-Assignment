    "#### Q1. Does assigning a value to a string's indexed character violate Python's string immutability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes. Since strings are immutable, we cannot assign value to a string's indexed character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. Does using the += operator to concatenate strings violate Python's string immutability? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Using the += operator to concatenate strings doesn't violate Python's string immutability. Although, instead of numeric addition, += is interpreted as string concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. In Python, how many different ways are there to index a character?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. There are two ways to index a character:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using positive index number to access characters,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. By using negative index number to access characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. What is the relationship between indexing and slicing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \"indexing\" is a reference to an element of an iterable sequence. This starts from 0 where 0 is the first elemnet of a sequence. If we use negative indexing, it will start from -1 and -1 refers to the last element of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"slicing\" is a subset of elements of an iterable sequence. We can slice a sequence given the starting and ending indeces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg.\n",
