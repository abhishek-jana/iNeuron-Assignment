    "#### 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Machine learning is a way to improve performace of certain tasks by learning from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. ML is good for:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Complex problems with no algorithmic solution, \n",
    "-Adapt to fluctuating environments\n",
    "-Help getting insights from large data \n",
    "-Replace large list of hand tuned rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Labeled traing set is dataset containing desired solution of each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The two most important supervised tasks are: regression and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Examples of unsupervised tasks are: clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Reinforcement learning would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. If we don't know the final groups, we can use clusturing algorithms(unsupervised learning). If we Know the group assigned to customers, we can use classification algorithm(supervised learning) to predict which customer falls into what group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It is a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Online learning is continuous learning instead of batch learning. This helps the model to learn from changing data and autonomous systems, and training on large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Out-of-core learning is a method to learn from a huge data that cannot be fit into computer's memory. In this method, the data set is divided into mini batches and uses online learning to learn from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An instance based learning learns the training data by heart and then given a new data it finds the most similar learned instance and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Model parameters are parameters of the model itself, for example slope of a linear regression model. These determines how well the model is to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are paramets of the algorithm which regularizes the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Model-based learning algorithms look for optimal values of the model parameters to make good preditions to new instances. \n",
    "\n",
    " The most popular method they use to achieve success is minimizing the cost function and putting a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized.\n",
    " \n",
    " To make predictions we feed a new instance to the parameter values of trained model using found by the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Four of the most important Machine Learning challenges are : lack of data, overfitting, underfitting, poorquality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. This is a possible case of overfitting. Three possible options are: getting more data, using a simpler model to reduce the features and complexity, and reducing the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Test set is used to calculate the generalized error to new instances before using the model for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Validation set is used to compare different models and find the best model and tune the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Train-dev kit is used when there is a possibility of mismatch in the training data and test, validation data. Train-dev is a part of training data that is held out and used later alongwith validation data to check the error. If the model predicts well on train-dev batch but not so well on validation data, then there is a data mismatch. If the model is performing well only on traing data but not so well on both train-dev and validatoin data, then the model is probably overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Tuning hyperparameter on test set will increase the risk of overfitting on test data, hence we'll get optimisitc model on test data but it will perform worse on real world problem."
