    "#### Q1. Raindrops are falling at an average rate of 20 drops per square inch per minute. What would be a reasonable distribution to use for the number of raindrops hitting a particular region measuring 5 inches2 in t minutes? Why? Using your chosen distribution, compute the probability that the region has no rain drops in a given 3 second time interval. A reasonable choice of distribution is P\n",
